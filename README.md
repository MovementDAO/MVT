# MVT - The Movement Token

The Movement is a truly decentralized organization. To incentivize activity and to allow participants from all around the world to take part in the ongoing development and governance of the DAO and its virtual headquarter Greenpoint, The Movement introduces MVT (The Movement Token).

No ICO has been held, and no funds have been raised. The Movement is the world’s first fully crowdsourced DAO. To ensure a wide range of early participants, only one account per person was allowed to sign up for the initial free distribution on Bitcointalk — alt accounts and robots were effectively removed by an extensive audit system. After a final audit of thousands of applicants, 557 initial early adopters were accepted. In order to distribute MVT in a fair and beneficial manner, every participant’s activity towards the project was measured. The Movement is entirely owned and shaped by those who take part in its development and governance. Owning any amount of MVT means to be an owner of The Movement. There is no central leader. Connect with fellow humans across cultures and borders. Create valuable networks and sustainable environments. Completely independent from third party entities or interests, and evolving freely.

There are 3 million MVT in total, of which 2,700,000 were initially distributed to early participants according to their respective efforts towards the creation of The Movement's early foundations, and 300,000 were allocated to the Bounty Fund. No additional MVT can ever be created.
