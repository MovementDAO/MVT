# MVT - The Movement Token

The Movement is an open and fully decentralized organization for the advancement of borderless collaboration and grassroots innovation, featuring a virtual headquarter (Greenpoint) in the Decentraland VR world. Driven by the vision of building bridges across borders and cultures, The Movement is creating and enhancing decentralized networks based on trust and friendship. Dedicated to bringing about new opportunities for all, it is collectively shaped and governed by us internet citizens.

To incentivize activity and to allow anyone to take part in the ongoing development and governance of our DAO, The Movement's native token MVT is used. Anyone who holds any amount of $MVT (The Movement Token) is an owner and participant. 

No ICO has been held, and no funds have been raised. The Movement is the world’s first fully crowdsourced DAO. To ensure a wide range of early participants, only one account per person was allowed to sign up for the initial free distribution on Bitcointalk — alt accounts and robots were effectively removed. After the final audit of thousands of applicants, 557 initial early adopters were accepted and are set in stone on the Genesis Participant List. In order to distribute MVT in a fair and beneficial manner, every participant's contributions were rewarded proportionally. The Movement is entirely owned and shaped by those who take part in its development and governance. There is no central authority. Connect with fellow humans across cultures and borders. Create valuable networks and sustainable environments. Evolving freely, independent from third-party entities.

There are 3 million MVT in total, of which 2,700,000 were initially distributed to early participants according to their respective efforts, and 300,000 were allocated to the Bounty Fund. No additional MVT can ever be created.
